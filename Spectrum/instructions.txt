Spectrum by Harry Grubman

Use:

Spectrum is used to select RGB (Red, Green, Blue) values of colors that can be
used in other programs. You can increase and decrease values of separate colors
between the minimum and the maximum (0 and 255 respectively). These colors can
be saved in patches at the bottom, which will be saved in a file in the content
folder, "saved_colors.txt". You can save a maximum of three colors at a time,
but the patches can be reset.

Instructions:

Q - Red +
A - Red -
W - Green +
S - Green -
E - Blue +
D - Blue -
F - Save Current Color
R - Reset
X - Exit and Save
